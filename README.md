# Monster-Maker-Decorator-Pattern
Using the Decorator Pattern, create a monster maker program that uses three base types
of monsters (ex. Alien, Beast, Zombie, Vampire, Mummy, etc.). Those monsters can
then be decorated with at least three different monster abilities (ex. lasers, poison, flying,
speed, strength, fire, etc.).
